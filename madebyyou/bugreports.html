			<h1>Why are bug reports important?</h1>
			Quite simple: there are so many features in XKit, and Tumblr is
			always changing things. Most of these changes are invisible to the user,
			since they are related to how data is transmitted to Tumblr servers,
			or the client-side implementation of some Tumblr features. Since
			I don't use all of the features of XKit, every day, it is impossible for me
			to spot most of the errors without your help.
			
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>for every change Tumblr makes that is visible 
			to the user, there are over 20 changes invisible to them.</h1></div>
			
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<h1>Changes? Like what?</h1>
			I'm going to give you two simple examples: one when Shuffle Queue
			stopped working (on both XKit 7 and XKit 6) and when XInbox's tagging
			feature stopped working (on XKit 6 only).<br/><br/>
			
			<b>Shuffle Queue</b><br/>
			Around a week ago, an user reported that Shuffle Queue was not working.
			I've inspected the page and code and found out that Tumblr made a
			small change: they've changed the capitalization of a function. In
			JavaScript, functions are case-sensitive: "myfunction" is not the same
			as "myFunction". And that's what they did. So Shuffle Queue stopped working,
			I've updated it and published it, which took ~5 minutes, and everything was OK.
			
			<br/><br/>
			<b>Shuffle Queue II: Queue Strikes Back</b><br/>
			Less than a week after Tumblr changed the way arranging queued posts works,
			they've changed it again: this time, completely changing the way it works.
			I've spent over 4 hours rewriting the extension, while trying to reverse-engineer
			how it was working. And now, we have Shuffle Queue back.
			
			<br/><br/><b>XInbox</b><br/>
			Just yesterday, Tumblr changed the ID of the Inbox body from
			"messages_submissions" to "messages_submissions_inbox".  A small change,
			and invisible to the user, but it confused XInbox, so it decided that the user
			was not in the inbox, so it did not switch on the tagging function built-in.
			
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<h1>In short</h1>
			In short, your bug reports keep me up to date with the Tumblr
			changes that I would probably miss without your help.<br/>
			So please keep them coming! Every bug report means one less bug
			for you other others to deal with.
