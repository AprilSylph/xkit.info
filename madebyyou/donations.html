			<h1>Warning: Outdated</h1>
			Some information on this page is outdated, I'm working on updating it.<br/>
			I'm sorry about this.
			
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
		
			<h1>Why do you need donations?</h1>
			Simple: XKit is free of charge, always has been, always will be. I never do anything
			that can remotely make me money, for example: I've been contacted by four corporations around the world who
			specializes in targeted advertising, asking me to give them anonymous XKit user
			data for a monthly fee. Even though they assured me they are completely anonymous,
			I've rejected, because your data, your usage patterns and habits belong to you:
			they should not be processed, parsed and used to make money. Since I reject
			offers like this, I not only not make money off XKit, I actually, some months,
			lose money.
			
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<h1>What else?</h1>
			I spend at least ~2 hours daily (I've been spending over 9 hours daily in order
			to prepare XKit 7) to respond to asks, update extensions, and make sure every
			server and extension is up and running. This is a time consuming hobby.
			
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<h1>How is my money used?</h1>
			
			<div class="chart">
				<img src="/sevenr/i/chart.png">
				<div class="chart-text">
					Approximately, since I'm always
					upgrading or downgrading servers depending
					on usage. (Upgrading these days, a lot, though)<br/><br/>
					Most of the spending goes to XIM servers, followed
					by XKit Servers (used to push News, updates,
					and install XKit itself.)<br/><br/>
					The rest goes to domain names such
					as XKit.info and studioxenix.com and Voxous.com
					(used by XIM), this represents a really small
					percentage since they are yearly. (around $80/year)<br/><br/>
					Coke<sup>1</sup> is bought only when there is extra money
					left by the end of the month, to keep me awake.
				</div>

			<small><small><sup>[1]</sup> Coca-Cola, that is. They don't sell Vanilla Coke where I live btw, that makes me sad.</small></small>
			
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<h1>What did the donations do so far for XKit?</h1>
			
			First, it encouraged me to spend so much time on XKit 7, which resulted
			in one of the most stable and fastest XKit, ever. Secondly, with that money,
			I was able to buy, then upgrade, the XIM servers, which you can now use
			with much, much less downtime. (When XIM was first released, it would
			be down for ~8-9 hours every day, it is less than 20 minutes every 2 weeks now.)
