			<h1>First, an apology.</h1>
			I usually don't reply to suggestion asks. The reason for that is simple,
			I get a lot of asks, and most of the time I spend replying to asks,
			I spend replying to bug reports. But that does not mean I don't read and
			try to implement them. This is a list of things suggested by you,
			and implemented by me, sometimes a few days later, sometimes a few
			months later, but implemented in the end.
			
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<h1>What was suggested and implemented?</h1>
			Below is a brief list of features I've implemented based on suggestions,
			on top off my head. Sorry, I don't remember who suggested them (usually,
			they are 5+ people who request the same feature), nor I remember most of the suggestions themselves.
			
			<ul class="more-space">
			
				<li><b>XKit Mail Notifications</b><br/>
					A lot of people complained about the red "+1" bubble on top of the
					XKit icon can be confused for an inbox alert, so on XKit 7, I've removed the
					bubble, and make it a notification that shows up on the bottom left
					corner of the screen.
				</li>
				
				<li><b>XKit Next-like framework</b><br/>
					A survey I did showed me that 85%+ of the people who used
					XKit Next liked it because it was faster and more responsive than
					XKit 6. As a result, XKit 7 is based on XKit Next, sharing ~40% of it's code.
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Better error messages</b><br/>
					The error messages on XKit 7 are less cryptic (ie: Error 1031),
					and more helpful: such as "You might need to reset XKit", followed
					by a reset and troubleshooting help buttons. XKit now alerts
					you when something <i>might</i> go wrong in the future,
					and that the extensions that it shares the page with might
					cause problems, making it easier for the user to identify
					and eliminate problems beforehand.
				</li>		
				
				<li><b>More customizable extensions</b><br/>
					A lot of people told me that they wanted XKit to be more
					customizable, and as a result, I've written XKit 7 in a way that
					it would be much, much easier to add preference buttons to
					extensions, so I can add more settings and make XKit more
					customizable.
				</li>
				
				<li><b>XIM</b><br/>
					XIM has been completely shaped by the suggestions
					I got from the XKit community, from message history to
					emoticons (and disabling of emoticons, afterwards),
					the whole user interface of XIM is a result of the suggestions
					I got from users like you. 
				</li>	
				
				<li><b>Percentages on Posting Crushes</b><br/>
					Someone before I started working on XKit 7 suggested that
					it should be possible to turn off the percentage display while
					posting your crushes, so I've implemented Post Crushes
					so that you can turn off them.
				</li>	
				
				<li><b>Panaroma, Only-Replies and much more!</b><br/>
					Nearly 60% of the extensions and options on XKit 7
					has been the result of requests by XKit users.
				</li>	
					
			</ul>
